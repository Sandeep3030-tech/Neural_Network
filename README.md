# Neural_Network
I am building a simple neural network to demonstrate how a basic model is structured and what it includes. 
This will involve preparing the data, designing the model architecture, training it, evaluating its performance and predicting on new values.

Before implementing any algorithm, it is crucial to visualize the dataset using graphs. 
This helps identify patterns,and understand relationships between variables so that an informed 
decisions can be made and select the most suitable model for the task.
Although I am not doing this in my current algorithm,
it is an important step in building a good machine learning model and should not be skipped.
